# BearMaps
Developed the back-end for a Berkeley map visualizer and navigation application in Java using Apache Maven as the build system and hosted on Heroku. The back-end employs image rasterization to display varying degrees of map detail depending on zoom level and displays optimal routes using the K-D tree data structure with A* graph search algorithm, powering the API the front-end makes requests to. Also implemented an auto-generated related results menu based on user input using the trie data structure.
